# ODE Mk 2 User Stories
## Format
Each user story should entered as a top level entry in the User Story List below.  It should begin with a user story number in the form of YYYY-XXX where YYYY is the full year and XXX is a zero padded numerical ID (incremented and reset with each year).  The user story statement is separated from its id by a colon and a space (: ).  

The user story statement should be in the shape of "As a _**person**_ I want to _**action**_ so that I can _**explanation**_."  For example, "As a _**Cylon**_ I want to _**hear the music**_ so that _**I can accept that I am a Cylon**_."

Putting it all together, here is a complete example:

* 2012-042: As a _**Cylon**_ I want to _**hear the music**_ so that _**I can accept that I am a Cylon**_.

## User Story List
