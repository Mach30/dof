_Based on contributions from Jeremy Wright._

= Remarks
* it needs to be possible to promote less accessible projects (or parts of those projects when they are in their own repos) to be more public/accessible
* it needs to be possible to demote projects (or parts of those projects when they are in their own repos) to be less accessible
* this use case should be supported as it promotes project evolution from restricted to more freely accessible
