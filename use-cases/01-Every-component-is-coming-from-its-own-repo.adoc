:revremark: First draft

== Remarks
* maximizes reuse and composition
* increases project complexity as every component must be tracked in its own repo and have its own configuration 
* leads to repos spawning faster than tribbles 
* this use case should be supported, it is the ivory tower ideal (make everything reusable) and was the only use case supported in initial drafts of the DOf methodolgy
