== Introduction

Mach 30 launched https://opendesignengine.net[Open Design Engine] (ODE) in 2012. Since then we have run our own OSHW projects on ODE, observed other groups host OSHW projects on ODE and other sites, and held numerous conversations on and offline about the nature of hosting OSHW projects.  Our conclusion after all these years and experience is the same one we held back in 2012:  the OSHW community is still searching for a project hosting solution that meets the needs of hardware projects (where documentation is part of the source code).

What has changed is our approach to addressing OSHW project hosting.  This time we are starting with the development of a tool independent methodology for developing and sharing OSHW, the Distributed OSHW Framework (DOF).  What do we mean by methodology?  

The Distributed OSHW Framework will be a systematic approach identifying:

* What needs to be shared
* How it should be shared
* The relationships between the various kinds of shared content

Note how developing a methodology is different from identifying best practices, covering case studies, and creating definitions.  A methodology is something one follows; it is a fully defined process.  And by targeting tool independence, we can aim for developing a solution that will stand the test of time, just as version control methods have lasted through cvs, svn, and now git.

== Stakeholder Needs
 
The development of the Distributed OSHW Framework (DOF) is guided by a series of stakeholder needs, listed below.


.Stakeholder Need 1: OSHW Definition
****
OSHW projects should be developed and shared in accordance to the https://www.oshwa.org/definition/[OSHW Definition].
**** 

.Stakeholder Need 2: OSHW Certification
****
OSHW projects should be developed and shared in accordance to the https://certification.oshwa.org/process.html[OSHW Certification process].
**** 

.Stakeholder Need 3: OSHW should be like OSS
****
Open Source Hardware should be like Open Source Software to the greatest degree possible (e.g. sharing, development, licensing).
**** 

.Stakeholder Need 4: OSHW Source Definition
****
The source of an OSHW project is its:  *Bill of Materials Data* (list of components and counts covering all parts which must be purchased to build the project), *Assembly Instructions* (complete list of instructions to build the project from its purchased parts), and *Supporting Documentation* (e.g. design files, schematics, operating instructions)
**** 


== User Stories

DOF's stakeholder needs are then used to identify a series of user stories which then lead to design decisions captured in data structure and activity definitions.


=== User Story 1: Branch OSHW

****
As a *OSHW Developer* I want to *use branches in the development of OSHW* so that I can *modify the project source in parallel lines of development*.
****

*Example:* Creating a v1 branch to preserve and maintain v1 source as part of OSHW certification compliance.  New development can then happen on trunk or a v2 branch.


=== User Story 2: Fork OSHW

****
As a *OSHW Developer* I want to *fork OSHW projects* so that I can *modify the project source in my own epository*.
****

*Example:* Forking a project to customize its design for my own purposes (e.g. swapping out a controller board, adjusting it to fit me).


=== User Story 3: Merge OSHW

****
As a *OSHW Developer* I want to *merge project source* so that I can *integrate changes from a branch or fork into my current source*.
****

*Example:* Incorporating suggested source changes from a contributor who forked the project to develop a new feature for the project.


=== User Story 4: Composition of OSHW

****
As a *OSHW Developer* I want to *include external projects as elements of my project* so that I can *build upon previous engineering effort (my own or othersâ€™)*.
****

*Example:* Using an Arduino Uno as the controller board for an OSHW robot project.
