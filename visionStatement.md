# Distributed Open Source Hardware Framework (DOF) Vision Statment

|||
|-|-|
| **For** | OSHW Standards and Tool Developers |
| **Who** | need a standardized approach for developing, distributing, and collaborating on OSHW "source code" |
| **The Distributed Open Source Hardware Framework (DOF)** | is a framework |
| **That** | prescribes a methodology for capturing, sharing, and documenting OSHW designs within software source code repositories |
| **Unlike** | the current unstructured approach of using siloed solutions for each aspect of OSHW design (e.g. CAD models in one repo, EE design in another, and software source code in yet another) |
| **Our product** | will provide an integrated set of standards for defining/reusing/maintaining OSHW components (design, interfaces, behaviors) and composing OSHW components from new or existing components |
