= Remarks
* one of the most important functions of BoM data is to ensure we have all of the materials on hand required to build the project
* therefore we need a list of all COTS components/materials that need to be purchased to build every sub-component (all the way down) that is sorted by COTS component names and includes total quantity required to build all of the sub-components
* this use case should be supported as it enables users to prepare for complete project builds, preventing the deeply annoying event of being 1 widget short of finishing a build (which is compounded if said widget has a week long lead time)
