== Remarks
* minimizes complexity as everything you need is in a single repo
* makes reuse and composition all but impossible 
* this use case should be supported - 
** it is ideal for simple projects
** should not force users to adopt the ivory tower ideal
** *projects using this approach can always be refactored to move components to their own repos* -- _in fact, this is another use case, and is likely the prescribed starting point, so it needs to be super easy to refactor to move components into their own repo_
